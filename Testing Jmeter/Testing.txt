Life cycle of Performance testing:
--------------------------------------
1. Requirements gathering
 
2. Planning/Design
 
3. Test execution
 
4. Result analysis
 
----------------------------------------
 
1. Requirements gathering. 
 
. what is the application we are going to test -
. how much user load need to be tested
. what is the functionality of the application. why it is bulit
. what is the technology used to build the application
. what is the server architecture
. Hardware details of application environment. 
 

what is the application we are going to test - e commerce application, ticket booking application, banking apploicaion, telceom application
 
how much user load need to be tested - 1000 users per hour, 10000 users per day. 
 
what is the functionality of the application. why it is bulit - basci user functionality
 
what is the technology used to build the application - Java, database ( Oracle/SQL ), what OS this is deployed
 
what is the server architecture - what type of app server is used ( web logic, web sphere etc), what type of web server (apache tomcat, glassfish ) is used
 
hardware details - app server, web server, db serever ( what amount of Memory each server is having installed ( 32 GB RAM ) webs erver ( 16 GB RAM ), DB server ( 100 GB RAM )
applicationserver ( 16 core cpu , processor) web server ( 8 core cpu ) DB server ( 32 core cpu ) 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
2. Planning/Design
 
. how many no of tests will be executed
. what type of performanc metrics to be collected
. what is the timelines 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Test execution 
 
. create test scenarios
. tester will execute all PT activities
. collect results of all tests
------------------------------------------------------
4. Reporting'
. create test reports
. analyse test reports
. find any performance issues.

steps of recording:

1. open jmeter using jmeter.bat file

2. click on templates option - green color icon

3. clikc on create on recording templates

4. go to IE

5. change proxy settings - to address ( localhost) port ( 8888 - it should match with jmeter port )

6. go to jmeter and clikc on start button ( means recording is started )

7. change transaction name to launch in transaction controller

8. launch webtours on IE

9. continue with next stpes change transaction name according

10. stop recording

11. check if all transactions recorded or not

1.record jpetsotre2.change transaction names

3. make thread count as 3 users

4. execute it for 5 mins

5. rampup is 30 seconds

6. save results in csv

7. format results
